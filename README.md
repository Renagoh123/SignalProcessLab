# SignalProcessLab
This repository contains coursework related to Intelligent Signal Processing (ISP), focusing on signal preprocessing, computer vision, audio processing, and data compression techniques. The project involves developing various applications for traffic monitoring, audio compression, video format verification, and emerging AI-driven solutions in signal processing.

## Exercise Descriptions
ðŸš— **Exercise 1: Traffic Monitoring with Computer Vision**
This exercise develops an automated traffic monitoring system using OpenCV, employing frame differencing and background subtraction to detect and count vehicles in traffic camera recordings

ðŸŽµ **Exercise 2: Audio Compression & Processing**
This task implements Rice coding for lossless compression of WAV files, evaluating its efficiency at different bit-lengths. The goal is to optimize storage while maintaining high audio quality, exploring ways to improve compression rates.

ðŸŽ¥ **Exercise 3: Video Format Verification & Conversion**
This exercise automates video format validation and conversion using ffprobe and ffmpeg. It detects incorrect video parameters and converts files to meet predefined standards, ensuring compliance with digital media submission guidelines.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- OpenCV (Computer Vision)
- ffmpeg & ffprobe (Video Processing)
- Rice Coding Algorithm (Lossless Compression)
